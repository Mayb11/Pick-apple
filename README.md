This project is a small game to pick up apples. It consists of two key inputs, one SW input,  one LCD screen display output (LT24) and two LEDR outputs. The game interface is that a green square (people) at the bottom of the screen can be controlled by key 3(left move) and key2(right move) so that the falling apple can be caught. A red square (apple), falling at a fixed speed from the top of the screen, randomly produces a new apple at the top of the screen whenever the apple is caught or landed, falling at the same speed until the player closes the machine or pauses the game. In addition, there is a successful or failed feedback , if the apple is caught, LEDR9 will blink once, if the apple lands, LEDR7 will blink once. The user can first start and continue running by put the SW switch high. Apple will fall at an acceptable speed, and users can control the left and right movement of the people by pressing key3 and key2 to catch the apple. And whether or not people catch the apple, there will be feedback to the player to understand his current situation. After a period of time, the user can reset the SW switch to initialize the game (if user put the switch back to the original position only, they can pause the game).
